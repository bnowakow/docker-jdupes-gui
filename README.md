# jdupes and jdupes-gui in Docker optimized for Unraid
jdupes is a command line program for identifying and taking actions upon duplicate files combined with jdupes-gui it becomes a usefull tool for identifying duplicated files on your server.

**A WORD OF WARNING:** jdupes IS NOT a drop-in compatible replacement for fdupes!

**ATTENTION:** A minor inconvenience is caused by the fact that the jdupes-gui script is single-threaded. This causes the application to seemingly hang when running long jobs like searching through large folders or deleting large batches of files. Please be patient, it is still working.

**WARNING:** Please always double check what you are deleting in the containers since this affects the files on your Server and you won't be able to recover them!!!

```

### Webgui address: http://[SERVERIP]:[PORT]/vnc.html?autoconnect=true

## Set noVNC Password:
 Please be sure to create the password first inside the container, to do that open up a console from the container (Unraid: In the Docker tab click on the container icon and on 'Console' then type in the following):

1) **su $USER**
2) **vncpasswd**
3) **ENTER YOUR PASSWORD TWO TIMES AND PRESS ENTER AND SAY NO WHEN IT ASKS FOR VIEW ACCESS**

Unraid: close the console, edit the template and create a variable with the `Key`: `TURBOVNC_PARAMS` and leave the `Value` empty, click `Add` and `Apply`.

All other platforms running Docker: create a environment variable `TURBOVNC_PARAMS` that is empty or simply leave it empty:
```
    --env 'TURBOVNC_PARAMS='
```

This Docker was mainly edited for better use with Unraid, if you don't use Unraid you should definitely try it!
